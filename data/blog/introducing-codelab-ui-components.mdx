# 🚀 **Welcome to CodeLab's Open Source Cohort!**

**👋 Hey there, Open Source Enthusiasts!** Open source is here, and it's ready for **your** contributions! Whether you're looking to gain **real-world industry experience**, build your portfolio, or just have fun collaborating with like-minded developers, you're in the right place. This cohort is all about **learning by doing**—no resumes, no interviews, just passion and effort. Let's dive into what we'll be building together!

## **🎨 Our Project: A React Component Library**

We're building a **modern, CodeLab-themed React Component Library** that's reusable, customizable, and perfect for web development. The stack? Glad you asked!

### **Tech Stack:**

- **Next.js** - For a powerful, scalable React-based framework.
- **Tailwind CSS** - To keep our styling clean and mobile-friendly.
- **ShadCN** - A headless UI component library to speed up development.
- **Storybook** - For interactive documentation and live component demos.

We'll be designing components that are easy to use, beautifully styled, and documented for smooth adoption. **Think of it as building Lego blocks for web apps!**

## **📌 What You Need to Know Before You Start**

### **1️⃣ No Experience? No Problem!**

This cohort is open to **everyone**. You don't need to be an expert—just bring your enthusiasm and willingness to learn.

### **2️⃣ GitHub is a Must!**

We'll be using **GitHub** to track issues, assign tickets, and submit pull requests. You should have a **basic understanding of GitHub**, including:

- Cloning repositories
- Branching
- Making pull requests
- Merging changes (but don't worry, mentors will handle this part!)

If you're new to GitHub, take some time to brush up on the basics!

### **3️⃣ Get Familiar with Our Tech Stack**

While we don't expect you to be an expert, having a **basic understanding** of the following will help you contribute effectively:

- **Next.js** - Learn how routing and components work.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Understand utility-based styling.
- **ShadCN** - Familiarize yourself with its pre-built components.
- **Storybook** - Explore how we document and demo our UI components.

**Bonus:** We'll be sharing component designs via **Figma**, so a basic understanding of Figma is also helpful!

## **📌 How to Contribute**

We operate on a **ticket-based system**, meaning all tasks will be assigned through **GitHub Issues**. Here's how it works:

✅ **Tickets will be released every 1-2 weeks.** Each ticket includes:

- A **ShadCN component link** 📌
- A **Figma design** 🎨

✅ **Claim a ticket only if you're comfortable with the tech!** This keeps development efficient.

✅ **One ticket per person per release.** No hoarding! If you miss out, no worries—there's always the next batch.

✅ **Tickets must be completed within two weeks.** Struggling to finish? Reach out to a mentor!

🚀 **First ticket drop: February 5th, 2025!** Stay tuned in the announcements channel!

Need help? We got you! Weekly office hours (schedule coming soon) will be available for debugging and guidance.
