## About CodeLab

CodeLab is a UC Davis student-run tech consulting club powered by interdisciplinary teams of software developers,
UX designers, and project managers. Our **Client** teams work with industry leading companies, but we also welcomed our
**Product** and **AI** teams this year. Our Product team created an app from idea to launch while our AI team created an
AI-powered product. Over the 2024-2025 school year we had 16 teams and worked with 11 clients.

## Event Overview

The CodeLab Product Showcase featured 11 dynamic student teams from our Winter and Spring cohorts,
each delivering 3-minute pitch-style presentations designed to spark curiosity and excitement about their products.
These short but impactful presentations served as previews, encouraging the audience to visit their
Medium articles to dive deeper into their team's process.

Adding to the night's inspiration, the event also welcomed four distinguished keynote
speakers—[Anna Marrero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alpmarrero/),
[Greg Larkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greglarkin/),
[Heather Meeker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heathermeeker/),
and [Katherine Druckman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherinedruckman/)—each
bringing their unique perspectives and experiences to the forefront.

## Winter Quarter Team Presentations

Our Winter Quarter teams started presentations off with a bang, showcasing the
culmination of their 1-2 quarters of work that tackled real-world challenges.

One team partnered with a **Fortune 15 Renewable Energy and Natural Gas** company (under NDA),
delivering a polished full-stack application that streamlined internal workflows and enhanced
productivity. Another team worked with **Circle** to build a generative AI hub that let users
generate many different kinds of creative work and pay with crypto-based metered billing,
complete with USDC integration and wallet-based authentication. Our collaboration with
**Solidigm** resulted in a powerful .NET-based OKR dashboard tailored to enterprise needs,
with a Dockerized handoff for seamless on-prem deployment. Finally, the **Goodnotes** team
crafted a proof-of-concept for integrated AI tools to augment notetaking with document
analysis and outline generation.

From secure authentication flows to polished UIs and robust backend infrastructure,
these projects reflected both technical rigor and user-centered thinking.
Each team brought their own flair—whether through creative UX, scalable engineering,
or tight client communication. The result was a showcase of what thoughtful,
cross-disciplinary teamwork can produce in just 8 weeks for most teams.

## Spring Quarter Team Presentations

We followed up with more amazing presentations from our Spring Quarter teams who
displayed work that CodeLab has yet to seen yet in the AI and AR space.

We had many familiar clients from Winter Quarter such as Solidigm and Goodnotes
who innovated new technology utilizing fine-tuning AI techniques. Our **Solidigm AI** team
built out a custom RAG architecture for past service tickets, solutions, and product
specifications! Furthermore, our **Goodnotes** Spring Quarter team reimagined what
note taking may look like in the future by building out an Agentic AI workflow to
generate diagrams, charts, images, and more with just natural language.

We also saw new clients with both Snap Inc. and Reddit! Our **Snap Inc.** team worked
on the exciting new universe of Augmented Reality where they designed and developed
new AR experiences using Snap's Lens Studio. They created an Animal Kingdom in the
world of AR where you can find out your Zodiac, visit a Pet Gala, and more! Last but
not least, our **Reddit** team brought the MLB straight to your phone by creating a new
way to experience the game live! They developed a mobile app to offer an interactive
MLB scoreboard experience utilizing the Reddit platform.

Our spring quarter teams were able to accomplish a lot in the past 8 weeks and
we're so excited for all the projects that were developed!

## New Programs: AI and Product Cohorts

CodeLab started 2 new programs this year focused around both AI and Product!
We were really excited to see the amazing projects that they built out in the
past year and were astonished from the results!

Our **AI** Cohort built Volare, a new AI solution to practice interviews as many times
as you would like! You are able to hop on a call with an AI interviewer who will
interview you in real time where you will receive feedback following the mock interview!

Our **Product** Cohort built Pinpoint, the new solution for UC Davis students to locate
their lost items. Many students tend to have lost track of an item at some point in
their college experience, and UC Davis' lost and found process is very difficult.
Pinpoint is able to skip the middle step and provides a place to share and claim
lost items on a single platform!

## Thank You to Our Community

We'd like to thank everyone who made the showcase possible. From our board who
tirelessly worked through every logistics related detail, to our cohort who truly
shined during each presentation and without whom CodeLab would not be possible, and to
our faculty advisors who have supported us every step of the way, CodeLab would
not be what it is without you all.

If you're inspired by any part of our mission or event, please get involved by
applying to our next cohort or collaborate with us as our next big client project!

See you all next year!
